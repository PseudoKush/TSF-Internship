# Supervised-Machine-Learning  

Task 2 of The Sparks Foundation Internship was to explore Supervised Machine Learning on the given dataset. The dataset comprised of 2 columns - hours and score. 
The objective was to apply Supervised machine learning algorithm and to find out the relation between number of hours studied per day and the score obtained by the student. 
Then we need to apply the model on the given test case of 9.25 hours and to predict the score.  
This task helped me to explore various Regression model and different data exploration skills that can be performed on a small dataset. 
I also learned how to connect Machine Learning Model with frontend so that a Web Application can be made which the user can directly use to obtain the result for 
their desired input without having to go through the whole code.  

Dataset: "http://bit.ly/w-data"  
Tools Used:   
            - Jupyter Notebook - for creating ML model  
            - HTML/CSS - for creating webpage  
            - Flask - for linking ML model with HTML  
 Result: RMSE score: 4.509
